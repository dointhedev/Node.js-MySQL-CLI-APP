This repo is functionality in-complete â€” PRs and issues welcome it's 90% done!!

## Project Overview

In this example, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and Nodejs. This app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. As well as having manager and supervisor user roles.

# Getting started

- Install Nodejs on your Mac ([Download](https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew))
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- load the .sql file locally and make sure the credentials match up. 
- 'mysql.server start' Start the local database server
- `node bamazonCustomer.js` to start the customer side of this demonstatration
- `node bamazonManager.js` to start the manager side of this demonstatration
- `node bamazonSupervisor.js` to start the supervisor side of this demonstatration
